Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool. </br>
All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective.</br>
It ensures whether the application is working, as mentioned in the requirement document or not. </br>
Test cases are planned and implemented to complete almost 100 percent of the software application.</br>
Test case reports are also generated manually.</br>

Manual Testing is one of the most fundamental testing processes as it can find both visible and hidden defects of the software.</br>
The difference between expected output and output, given by the software, is defined as a defect. </br>
The developer fixed the defects and handed it to the tester for retesting.</br>
